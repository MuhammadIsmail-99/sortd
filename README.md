## 📖 Overview
**Sortd** is an innovation-driven content capture platform designed to bridge the "Capture Gap." In a world where digital inspiration is scattered across Instagram Reels, YouTube videos, and screenshots, Sortd provides a unified, AI-powered system to automatically extract, summarize, and categorize your digital universe.

### ⚠️ Problem Statement
Digital content consumption is fragmented. Users "Save" or "Bookmark" content across dozens of platforms, only for that information to be lost in a digital graveyard. Manually organizing these links or screenshots is time-consuming. Sortd automates this entire lifecycle, transforming raw links and images into organized, searchable, and actionable knowledge.

## 🛠️ System Design
Below is the architectural blueprint of the Sortd ecosystem, showcasing the vertical flow from user input to AI-driven organization.

## 🧠 AI Integration
Sortd leverages a sophisticated synergy between multimodal vision and high-fidelity audio transcription to provide a zero-effort organization experience:

1.  **Multimodal Vision (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash):** When a user uploads a screenshot, the system uses Gemini's vision capabilities to "see" the content. It is specifically tuned to ignore app UI elements (usernames, buttons, likes) and focus entirely on the core information—whether it's a quote, a recipe, or a job opportunity. It extracts text in multiple languages, including English, Urdu, and Arabic, preserving the original intent.
2.  **Audio Intelligence (Groq Whisper v3):** For video links (YouTube/Instagram), Sortd extracts the audio and utilizes Groq’s ultra-fast Whisper implementation to generate high-accuracy transcripts.
3.  **Autonomous Categorization:** The extracted text is then analyzed by Gemini to determine the best-fit list (e.g., "Learn", "Recipes", "Deals"). It generates a concise, catchy title and a structured Markdown summary, ensuring that every "clip" is immediately useful without manual editing.
